# Filter-Bubble-Networks
This is a data science project that uses network science to test the filter bubble in Google News and Facebook search results. 
Using a chrome extension that gathers links and the createGexf.py file, Google News and Facebook search results are represented as networks 
for different users. These networks are visualized using gephi and clusters are within them are created using modularity clustering.
